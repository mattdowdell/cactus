Design and Implement a Compiler for a Programming Language
==========================================================

Aims
====

- Design a programming language.
- Design and implement a compiler for said programming language capable of producing low-level code, such as assembler, to be run on at least one architecture.

Deliverables
============

- A specification for a programming language.
- A specification and implementation of a compiler for the said programming language.
- A set of example programs that are written in said language to demonstrate features and capabilities of the language.

Schedule
========

- October: Create initial programming language design with requirements, features and syntax.
- November: Create an interpreter for the programming language to test the language design and to be used as a basis for the compiler.
- December: Create a prototype compiler for the programming language.
- February: Finalise Language design.
- March: Complete compiler implementation.

Relevance
=========

Programming languages are the tools that enable software developers to practice their trade. However, despite this dependency, it is unusual for those practising programming to understand how the code they write is translated to something their computer understands, simply because there is often no perceived need to. Writing a compiler engenders a comprehension of how these tools work and by extension how a computer works. Therefore, this project is designed to improve my knowledge of the foundation of computer science.
