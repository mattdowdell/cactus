# Design and Implement a Compiler for a Programming Language

## Aims

* Design a programming language.
* Design and implement a compiler for said programming language capable of producing low-level code,
  such as assembler, to be run on at least one architecture.

## Deliverables

* A specification for a programming language.
* A specification and implementation of a compiler for said programming language.
* A set of example programs written in said language to demonstrate features and capabilities of
  the language.

## Schedule

* __October__: Create initial programming language design with requirements, features and syntax.
* __November__: Create an interpreter for the programming language to test the language design and
  to be used as a basis for the compiler.
* __December__: Create a prototype compiler for the programming language.
* __February__: Finalise Language design.
* __March__: Complete compiler implementation.

## Relevance

Programming languages are the tools that enable software developers to practice their trade.
However, despite this dependency it is unusual for those practicing programming to understand how
the code they write is translated to something their computer understands, simply because there is
often no percieved need to. Writing a compiler engenders a comprehension of how these tools work
and by extension how a computer works. Therefore, this project is designed to improve my knowledge
of the foundation of computer science.
